Now, create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM), typically with 2-4 Virtual CPUs. For username and password, it can be anything as we'll be using this info to remote in with our main computer. When creating the Virtual Machine (VM), allow Azure to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet):

Open your Remote Desktop Connection app on your computer and connect to your Virtual Machine that was created in Azure.

Now we need to install / Enable IIS in Windows. Go to your Search Bar > Type "Control Panel" > Click "Programs" > "Turn Windows features on or off" > Scroll down to "Internet Information Services (IIS).

Once clicked, find the "Internet Information Services" expand it and then expand the "World Wide Web" tab. Afterward, expand the application Developer tab. Finally check the "CGI" button & press Ok. You will need CGI to download the PHP Manager. The PHP manager is a back-end web programming language that allows osTicket to run off a web browser.
